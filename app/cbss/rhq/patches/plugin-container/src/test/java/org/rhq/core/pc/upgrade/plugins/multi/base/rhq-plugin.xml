        Only the inheriting plugins create the concrete resources based on the 
        classes defined in this abstract base plugin.
        
        These are the plugin configuration properties needed by the base plugin:
        
        key = the template to create the resource key from
        count = the number of resources to discover        
        upgradedKey = this *must* be specified on the resource type *to be upgraded* and
                      *must* be the same as the key template on the resource type that
                      it is upgraded to (i.e. the plugin.v1.upgradedKey == plugin.v2.key)
                      
        the discovery add a new property called "ordinal" to the plugin config
        of the created resources, which contains the index of that resource amongst
        its siblings.
        
        the key template can contain %n which is replaced by the ordinal and %p which
        is replaced by the ordinal of its parent.
        
        
        
        if the discovery component of the concrete resource is (or inherits from)
        BaseUpgradingDiscoveryComponent, it can specify further plugin config properties
        influencing the upgrade:
        
        failUpgrade = true to throw an exception during upgrade
    -->
    
</plugin>
